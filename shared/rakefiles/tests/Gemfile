# The gems in this group can't be built inside the Exekube container (where
# CircleCI runs these tests). Hence, these versions must match the versions in
# the Exekube image built so that bundler will use the already-installed gems
# instead of trying to build gems it cannot build.
#
# Also, bundler running inside the Exekube container must not use '--path', as
# that will prevent bundler from picking up and using already-installed system
# gems.
